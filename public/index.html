                        <p>Blockly Code is a very small student lead company that works with young inspiring
                            developers teaching them the foundations of coding. I founded this company after 
                            seeing how difficult it was for new developers to get a good solid course in Computer
                            Science without having to pay a large sum of money. Blockly Code is founded on the 
                            idea that anyone regardless of who you are can come and learn the basics of coding for free.
                            This is by far the biggest project I have worked on, and yet the one I am most proud of!

                    <p>Infin Passes is once again a very small student lead orgnzaition. Our main mission is 
                        to help assist schools by creating them a customizable Hall Pass system that will fit 
                        their needs. This all started after I took AP computer science class, for one of the project
                        I made a demo version of what we have now. I then thought about scaling it up to fit an 
                        entire school. Following that I markerted it to several different schools and communitys that it could be used for.
                        This is the only product I made that I sell.

                    <p>This is one of my most sucessful apps I have published. With just under 60 thousand installs 
                        you can clearly see that people love this app! I created it 2 years ago when I was just getting 
                        started on my coding adventure! I saw that there wasn't very many open source ready to use apps out 
                        there of a ticketing app just like the Ticketing Tool discord bot. So I set out to create something amazing. 
                        Just a few months later I published the first version. and now just 2 years later I am still activly updating the 
                        app to work with Discord's new APIs! This app has also been featured in different articals writting by
                        many different people!

                        North Foxbridge Railways is a new game that I have been working on for the platform Roblox.
                        I currently hold the position of Development Manager alongside 1 other co-worker.
                        I oversee the entire development process of the game and manage a team of 12 developers 
                        working on different projects for the community. As a Development Manager my job also
                        includes meeting with the different departments giving them a brief overview of the
                        changes that have been made to the game in the past update so they can inform the 
                        supervisors. I do not have the direct community based role; it is more of a 
                        behind the scenes working with the teams that bring the experience to life.
                        On top of this I also do most of the scripting for the game's core system such
                        as scripting all the functions for the players GUI, scripting the
                        movement systems for the trains, ect. I have been in this position
                        since the game was founded and through my time I have learned many new things
                        about myself and about the team I work with.
