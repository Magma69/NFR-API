                        <p class="underHead">Position: CEO</p>
                        <p>Blockly Code is a very small student lead company that works with young inspiring
                            developers teaching them the foundations of coding. I founded this company after 
                            seeing how difficult it was for new developers to get a good solid course in Computer
                            Science without having to pay a large sum of money. Blockly Code is founded on the 
                            idea that anyone regardless of who you are can come and learn the basics of coding for free.
                            This is by far the biggest project I have worked on, and yet the one I am most proud of!

                    <h3>Infin Passes</h3>
                    <p class="underHead">Position: Owner/Founder</p>
                    <p>Infin Passes is once again a very small student lead orgnzaition. Our main mission is 
                        to help assist schools by creating them a customizable Happ Pass system that will fit 
                        thier needs. This all started after I took AP computer science and for one of the project
                        i made a demo version of what we have now. I then thought about scailing it up to fit an 
                        entire school. Following that I fought my way up the line until the school eventualy bought it!
                        This is the only product I made that I sell to others.

                    <p class="underHead">Views: 61.3k | Installs: 57.3K</p>
                    <p>This is one of my most sucessful apps I have published. With just under 60 thousand installs 
                        you can clearly see that people love this app! I created it 2 years ago when I was just getting 
                        started on my coding adventure! I saw that there wasn't very many open source ready to use apps out 
                        there of a ticketing app just like the Ticketing Tool discord bot. So i set out to create something amazing. 
                        Just a few months later I published the first version. and now just 2 years later I am still activly updating the 
                        app to work with Discords new APIs! This app has also been featured in many different articals writting by
                        many different people!
